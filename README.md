## PROJECT TOPIC: KULTRA MEAGA STORES INDUSTRY(KMS) ANALYSIS.

## PROJECT OVERVIEW:
The project was carried out as part of my data analysis learning journey. It aims to uncover insights from a sample dataset through data exploration, cleaning, and SQL-based analysis. Its aim is also to assist in business decision-making including identifying high- and low-performing products, customer trends, and revenue patterns.

Throughout this project journey, I was able to practice key analytical skills such as writing optimized SQL queries, drawing meaningful conclusions from raw data, and presenting findings in a clear and structured format. The project simulates real-world business analysis and reflects my enthusiasm to take on new challenges even as I continue developing my skills.

## DATA DESCRIPTION:
 The data set used for this analysis was provided as part of a structured project work. It was extracted from ms excel and queried in sql. It contains transactional data of kultra mega stores inventory, with its headquarters in Lagos and having one of its branches at abuja and it specializes in office supplies and furnitures. 
 The data set was collected at the abuja branch from the period of 2009-2012. It has a maximum of 8400 rows and 21 columns covering key variables such as:

a. Customer name: 
The full name of the customer who made the purchase. This helps identify which customer placed the order.

b. Order ID:
A unique identification code assigned to each order. This is used to track and differentiate one order from another.

c. Order Date:
The date when the order was placed. It helps in analyzing sales trends over time, like monthly or yearly performance.

d. Order Price:
The total cost of the items in the order before any discounts or additional charges (like shipping). This can also help in revenue tracking.

e. Sales:
The actual revenue generated from the order, which might include or exclude discounts depending on the dataset. Useful for profit and performance analysis.

f. Shipping Mode:
The method used to deliver the order to the customer (e.g., Standard Class, First Class, Same Day). Itâ€™s helpful for studying delivery efficincy.

g. Region:
The location or area where the order was delivered. This can be used to compare sales performance across different locations or markets
