## PROJECT OVERVIEW:
The project was carried out as part of my data analysis learning journey. It aims to uncover insights from a sample dataset through data exploration, cleaning, and SQL-based analysis. Its aim is also to assist in business decision-making including identifying high- and low-performing products, customer trends, and revenue patterns.

Throughout this project journey, I was able to practice key analytical skills such as writing optimized SQL queries, drawing meaningful conclusions from raw data, and presenting findings in a clear and structured format. The project simulates real-world business analysis and reflects my enthusiasm to take on new challenges even as I continue developing my skills.
